# Integrating Data Architectures for OECD Pillar Two Compliance

This repository presents a research poster project on optimizing enterprise data architectures to meet OECD Pillar Two regulations. It proposes Lakehouse architecture as a hybrid solution that blends the auditability of Data Warehouses with the flexibility of Data Lakes.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**Title**: Optimizing Compliance and Efficiency  
**University**: University of Derby (MSc Big Data Analytics)  
**Authors**: Efthymios Galanidis, Ioannis Amourgianos, Dimitrios Xatzis

### ðŸ“Š Objectives
- Analyze how enterprises can restructure their data systems for regulatory compliance
- Evaluate Data Warehouses, Data Lakes, and Lakehouses for performance and audit-readiness
- Visualize comparisons using compliance metrics and benchmarks

### ðŸ§ª Methodology
- **Qualitative**: OECD Pillar Two regulatory framework and academic literature
- **Quantitative**: TPC-DS benchmarks for query response and scalability (Salqvist, 2023)
- **Case Studies**: Cross-industry examples and practical architectural adaptations

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
- **Lakehouses** offer the best compromise between real-time compliance, cost-efficiency, and advanced analytics
- **Data Warehouses** excel in reporting speed and structure but lack flexibility
- **Data Lakes** support diverse data types but underperform in real-time reporting and auditability

## ðŸ§  About Me
This project draws from my academic research and hands-on experience working on Pillar II tax automation with ERP integrations at Deloitte. I'm pursuing an MSc in Big Data Analytics with a focus on regulatory data systems, data warehousing, and automation.
